This is in part because they hide the data structures of the intermediate representation (IR), instead\nallowing metaprogrammers to use the concrete syntax of the language they manipulate. Scala has had \u201csyntactic\u201d quasiquotes for a long time, but still misses a statically-typed version like in MetaOCaml, Haskell and F#. This safer flavor of quasiquotes has been particularly useful for staging and domain-specific languages.<\/p>\n<p>In this paper we present Squid, a metaprogramming system for Scala that fills this gap. Squid quasiquotes are novel in three ways: they are the first statically-typed quasiquotes we know that allow code inspection (via pattern matching); they are implemented purely as a macro library, without modifications to the compiler; and they are reusable in the sense that they can manipulate different IRs. Adapting (or binding) a new IR to Squid is done simply by implementing a well-defined interface in the style of object algebras (i.e., tagless-final). We detail how Squid is implemented, leveraging the metaprogramming tools already offered by Scala, and show three application examples: the definition of a binding for a DSL in the style of LMS; a safe ANF conversion; and the introduction of type-safe, hygienic macros as an alternative to the current macro system.\u201d<\/p>\n","w3lofw":"","xkkgis":"","nzuk6r":"","eoisgj":"","bb2dyo":"","4yxyoy":"","2u4np7":"<p>Abstract: \u201c\u2026future embedded applications will need high performance operating systems to support the intensive computing algorithms required for satisfying acceptable response and secure the application inside the vulnerable open environment; hence, new inevitable requirements for embedded operating systems have arisen including hard real-time response, support for native applications, system openness and system scalability.<\/p>\n<p>This paper introduces a new design for secure and open smart card operating system, called ESCOS (Egypt Smart Card Operating System), based on the prevalent <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Java_Card\" rel=\"nofollow\">Java Card<\/a> technology.

Like the battletested immutable sequences of Clojure and Scala, they have effectively constant lookup and updates, good cache utilization, but also logarithmic concatenation and slicing. Our goal is to bring the benefits of functional data structures to the discipline of systems programming via generic yet efficient immutable vectors supporting transient batch updates. We describe a C++ implementation that can be integrated in the runtime of higher level languages with a C core (Lisps like Guile or Racket, but also Python or Ruby), thus widening\nthe access to these persistent data structures.<\/p>\n<p>In this work we propose (1) an Embedding RRB-Tree (ERRB-Tree) data structure that efficiently stores arbitrary unboxed types, (2) a technique for implementing tree operations independent of optimizations for a more compact representation of the tree, (3) a policy-based design to support multiple memory management and reclamation mechanisms (including automatic garbage collection and reference counting), (4) a model of transience based on move-semantics and reference counting, and (5) a definition of transience for confluent meld operations. Combining these techniques a performance comparable to that of mutable arrays can be achieved in many situations, while using the data structure in a functional way.\u201d<\/p>\n","bfyysg":"","55zksr":"","gkcxl0":"","tze4zt":"","qt3ch0":""},"downvotes":{"fskvfo":0,"d42dv7":0,"xss2yb":0,"zgu5en":0,"omhcqr":0,"dklp5o":0,"czipl0":0,"ybiwto":0,"w2cd4l":0,"t0mxei":0,"w3lofw":1,"xkkgis":0,"nzuk6r":0,"eoisgj":0,"bb2dyo":1,"4yxyoy":0,"2u4np7":1,"fw6tz2":1,"xrcqg6":0,"khb6wl":0,"bfyysg":0,"55zksr":1,"gkcxl0":0,"tze4zt":0,"qt3ch0":0},"score":{"fskvfo":13,"d42dv7":3,"xss2yb":13,"zgu5en":4,"omhcqr":2,"dklp5o":18,"czipl0":1,"ybiwto":6,"w2cd4l":2,"t0mxei":1,"w3lofw":1,"xkkgis":1,"nzuk6r":14,"eoisgj":15,"bb2dyo":36,"4yxyoy":14,"2u4np7":0,"fw6tz2":0,"xrcqg6":4,"khb6wl":6,"bfyysg":22,"55zksr":9,"gkcxl0":30,"tze4zt":6,"qt3ch0":37},"short_id_url":{"fskvfo":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/fskvfo","d42dv7":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/d42dv7","xss2yb":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/xss2yb","zgu5en":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/zgu5en","omhcqr":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/omhcqr","dklp5o":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/dklp5o","czipl0":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/czipl0","ybiwto":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/ybiwto","w2cd4l":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/w2cd4l","t0mxei":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/t0mxei","w3lofw":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/w3lofw","xkkgis":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/xkkgis","nzuk6r":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/nzuk6r","eoisgj":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/eoisgj","bb2dyo":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/bb2dyo","4yxyoy":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/4yxyoy","2u4np7":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/2u4np7","fw6tz2":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/fw6tz2","xrcqg6":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/xrcqg6","khb6wl":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/khb6wl","bfyysg":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/bfyysg","55zksr":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/55zksr","gkcxl0":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/gkcxl0","tze4zt":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/tze4zt","qt3ch0":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/s\/qt3ch0"},"submitter_user":{"fskvfo":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nMastodon: [@calvin@cronk.stenoweb.net](https:\/\/cronk.stenoweb.net\/@calvin)\r\n\r\n[website](http:\/\/minisoc.xyz)\/`cal` `vin `{a}` `{t}` `cmpct.info`","is_moderator":false,"karma":24328,"avatar_url":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/avatars\/calvin-100.png","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"d42dv7":{"username":"HenriTuhola","created_at":"2017-10-11T17:37:54.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":41,"avatar_url":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/avatars\/HenriTuhola-100.png"},"xss2yb":{"username":"maxhallinan","created_at":"2017-07-05T09:16:05.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"[https:\/\/www.maxhallinan.com\/](https:\/\/www.maxhallinan.com\/)","is_moderator":false,"karma":164,"avatar_url":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/avatars\/maxhallinan-100.png","github_username":"maxhallinan"},"zgu5en":{"username":"friendlysock","created_at":"2014-02-20T00:43:41.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"*Literally* full of ants.\r\n\r\nFriendly engineer and human being.\r\n\r\nStrong opinions held weakly, sometimes weekly.\r\n\r\nHit me up at \"ch\" plus \"ris\" (at) \"k\" plus \"e\" plus \"dagital\" dot com.\r\n\r\n> Gentrification is the process by which nebulous threats are pacified and alchemised into money. \r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":14747,"avatar_url":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/avatars\/friendlysock-100.png"},"omhcqr":{"username":"sevan","created_at":"2013-06-02T17:42:02.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":3402,"avatar_url":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/avatars\/sevan-100.png"},"dklp5o":{"username":"mjturner","created_at":"2016-03-30T02:56:31.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Just another Unix geek.\r\n\r\n[mjturner.net](https:\/\/mjturner.net).","is_moderator":false,"karma":2379,"avatar_url":"https:\/\/lobste.rs\/avatars\/mjturner-100.png"},"czipl0":{"username":"adsouza","created_at":"2015-05-03T18:35:51.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm a software engineer at Google who has spent the past few years working on the infrastructure for geo data in a combination of C++ and Go, although I now work on cloud infrastructure (in Go).
